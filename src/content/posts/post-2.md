# <p class='text-3xl'>**Atomic habits - James Clear**</p>

1. To stick to the right behavior all the time, you need to **focus on the system, not the goals.** Goals are the desired results. The system is the path that will lead to the desired results.
2. The main focus of change should be on **what kind of person you want to become**, not what you want to get.
3. The new habit should be:
   1. **Obvious** (How can I make it obvious?).
   2. **Attractive** (How can I make it attractive?).
   3. **Easy** (How can I make it easy?).
   4. **Satisfying** (How can I make it satisfying?).
4. **Write out all the repetitive day to day actions(+, -, =).**
5. **Obviousness.** I will **[do] at [time] at [place].** When **situation A happens,** I will **do B.**
6. **Attractiveness**. After **[existing habit]** I will **[habit to be implemented],** after **[habit to be implemented]** I will **[action I want]**.
7. **Ease.** A new habit **should** not take a long time to implement.
8. **Rewarding. Reward yourself** after the right action.
